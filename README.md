## 📚 About This Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode + React solutions repository! Here, I use React to solve interactive coding problems, explore UI challenges, or even simulate algorithm behavior visually. This is a unique learning approach that combines frontend development and algorithmic thinking.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```
leetcode-react/
├── problems/
│   ├── 1-two-sum/
│   │   ├── App.jsx
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   └── styles.css
│   └── ...
├── public/
├── README.md
└── package.json
```

### 📁 Problem Folders

Each problem is a small standalone React app with:

- `App.jsx` containing the main component and logic
- `index.html` to render the React app
- `styles.css` for optional custom styling

### 📄 Naming Convention

Folder names follow this pattern:

```
<problem-number>-<problem-name>/
```

**Examples:**

- `1-two-sum/`
- `2-add-two-numbers/`
- `3-longest-substring/`

## ⚛️ Why React?

React helps you visualize complex logic and user interaction. This repo combines React’s strengths with LeetCode-style problems to:

- Strengthen component-based thinking
- Practice rendering logic
- Simulate algorithms (e.g., sorting visualizations, pathfinding, etc.)

## 🧪 Features per Solution

- ✅ **Clean component structure**
- 🧠 **React Hooks** for state and side effects
- 📝 **Comments** explaining logic and rendering
- 📐 **Performance tips** (e.g., memoization)
- 📊 **Visual output** of algorithm where applicable

## 📦 How to Run Locally

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-react.git
cd leetcode-react

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev server
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:5173/` (or your configured port).

## 🚧 Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Vite (already configured)
- A browser that supports modern JavaScript
